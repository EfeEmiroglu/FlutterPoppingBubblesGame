# Popping Bubbles

This is a game where you control a character (square for now) and try to avoid the bubbles that are bouncing up and down and by shooting them. There is no possible way of finishing the game, the game finishes when the user dies and it stores the user's name and their survive time, which later shows it on the "Highscores" table. The user can reset the value in this table by pressing the "Reset Highscores" button on the main page.

You can play this game by downloading it to your phone or ur pc.
